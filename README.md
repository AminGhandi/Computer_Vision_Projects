# Computer_Vision_Projects

This repository is dedicated to the implementation of various deep learning projects using PyTorch, specifically in the field of computer vision. The projects are based on the book "[Computer Vision Projects with PyTorch: Design and Develop Production-Grade Models](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-4470-8)".

## Topics Covered
The following topics, derived from the book's content table, will be covered in this repository:

- Image Classification
- Creating an Image Classification Pipeline
- Basic Model 
- The Second Variation of the Model: Data Augmentation
- The Third Variation of the Model: Batch Normalization Method
- The Fourth Variation of the Model: Regularization

Stay tuned as more materials will be added soon!
